# Javascript Data Structures

### What is a data structure?

- Collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data
  - An array is a basic example of a data structure
- Different data structures are good for different things. Some are highly specialized while others (like arrays) are widely used
- There is no 'best' data structure, they all excel in different situations
- Javascript has none of the data structures here pre-built, so we will have to write our own using ES2015 classes
